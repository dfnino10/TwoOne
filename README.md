# TwoOne
TwoOne is a web application designed for large families. On this website you can create family groups where you can share events, shopping lists and much more. This is a collaborative application then everything you do can be seen by your family and vice versa.

# Main Goal
We saw that it is very difficult for this people to organize such a large group. So, our main purpose was to bring an easy and complete tool to make their lives so much easier. Also, we are aware that many of this families live a busy life so while using this app they will have a lot of more time to use with the people they love.

# Technologies used
For this project we used:
- Meteor
- Bootstrap
- MongoDB
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
On the other hand, the application is deployed in Heroku

# How to run
## Prerequisites
It is important that the following tools have been downloaded for this project:
- Node:
To prove that node is installed on the system run the following command
```
node --version
```
it is recommended to have also installed nvm. 
You can find the step by step how to download Node it in the following link: https://github.com/nodejs/node

## How to run
1. Clone this repository
2. Type this command in order to install npm on the current folder. 
```
npm install
```
You will notice that every package that Meteor uses are going to be installed in this step.

3. Type this command in order to start npm
```
npm start
```
4. To be able to deploy it locally use the following URL: http: // localhost: 3000
5. Because we are also using MongoDB (specifically, the Meteor version) we will need to run the following command
```
meteor mongo
```
You will see that mongo will run and that you will have access to every collection that comes by default in meteor or that you created.
